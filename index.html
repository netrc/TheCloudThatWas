      <section>
        <p> Just some thoughts and consternation. Not as much a rant as a way to document a road not taken. 
        </p>
        <p> The main topic concerns AFS - The Andrew File System - but this should be read as a discussion about the idea of
          a distributed file system.
        <p>
          Apologies to the reader
          for the length and digressions; it's been a long road.

        <p> About 1995, I worked in a large financial services firm. </p>
        <p> Here I've got to stop to do a reality check... Doesn't this make sense? </p>

        <p>
          Some handy examples of side-notes and margin-notes here.<label for="sn-example-a" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-example-a" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Short sidenote/ref.</span>
          Again, stolen from Tufte github. Really have to keep the label and input And span text thing on same line.
          This is just some text in the same paragraph.
          Because the notes don't look very good on their own; there needs to be some body text.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new paragraph of text in which we'll embed a margin note that is longer, more interesting so to speak than
          a mere sidenote.
          <label for="mn-demo-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="marginnote">
            This is a numberless margin note that makes a comment or extra-special note about the text. The html tag placements are more lenient.   
          </span>
          And this is some text to finish up the paragraph. Presumably, this paragraph is particularly interesting and compelling
          to the extent that the margin note would be a distraction. On the other hand, the distraction is too compelling on its
          own to leave out. Something like that.
        </p>
